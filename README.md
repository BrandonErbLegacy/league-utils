Some simple utilities for League of Legends players with multiple accounts

# Commands

* help: This prints a help message displaying commands
* perm_save: This will create a save file for your current League of Legends settings
* perm_load: This loads the aforementioned save file
* temp_load: This creates another save file for your current League of Legends settings. This is useful for when you're on someone else's computer, or something similar and want to create a temporary settings file containing settings that are not yours
* temp_load: This loads the settings from the aforementioned temporary save file
* swap_region: This swaps your region between NA and LAN. The League of Legends client must be closed in order to use this

A quick note: The settings will not update in client when you use perm_save/load or temp_save/load. It however does actually update the settings (even while the client is open).
